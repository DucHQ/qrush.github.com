There's just too many things to pay attention to. I get questioned pretty frequently about this: how do you pay attention to nearly 1,500 people on your Twitter timeline? Here's an easy answer:

I don't.

It's impossible to. Here's a short selection of the "feeds" I had open today, at some point or another. 

* Twitter
* Facebook
* IRCCloud
* Campfire
* Basecamp
* Work Gmail
* Home Gmail
* Reddit
* Skype

This is just awful. It's addicting though. Several of them I can't shut off...for work and other reasons. Others I could probably spend a lot less time on. I don't have a "life hack" for this. However there are some things I've found that help:

1. Cancel your (LinkedIn, especially) account
2. Stop/disable all notifications on apps
3. Just put the fucking phone down

I'm going to try and remind myself of the third point as much as possible.
